  abstract = {In this article is shown that with high probability the thresholding
	algorithm can recover signals that are sparse in a redundant dictionary
	as long as the {\it 2-Babel function} is growing slowly. This implies
	that it can succeed for sparsity levels up to the order of the ambient
	dimension. The theoretical bounds are illustrated with numerical
	simulations. As an application of the theory {\it sensing dictionaries}
	for optimal average performance are characterised and their performance
	is tested numerically.},
