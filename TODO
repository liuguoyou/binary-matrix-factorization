* Matrix completion algorithm & learning with missing data

* Learn generic categorical matrices
- using Galois fields
- using 1 to N mapping

* Improve model selection using (possible) several seeds for each candidate dictionary size

* Perform thorough experiment of model selection using different dictionary update methods (proximus or not), different initialization, etc.

* Apply to medical images, perhaps binarize CT scans

* Evaluate on interestingdatasets:
- MovieLens (ratings 1-5, tomado de )
